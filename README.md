# Database Automation System

This project automates common database tasks, including backups, restores, and data cleanup. It uses Python to run SQL commands for SQL Server (or Oracle) and logs the execution details.

## ðŸš€ Project Setup

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/database-automation.git
   cd database-automation
```

### 2. Install Dependencies:
Make sure you have Python and the required libraries installed. Youâ€™ll need pyodbc for SQL Server (or cx_Oracle for Oracle).
